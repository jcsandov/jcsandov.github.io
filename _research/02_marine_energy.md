title: "Fluid Dynamics in Marine Energy"
excerpt: "In this area, I have focused on the effects on the flow of different models used to parameterise hydrokinetic turbines in tidal channels. In particular, I have worked on various actuator-based models and studied their impact on the coherent structures that govern the evolution of turbine wakes (mixing length, large-scale oscillations, turbulent statistics, among others).
