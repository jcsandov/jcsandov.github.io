title: "Mixing and transport in aquatic environments"
excerpt: "In this line of work, I have focused on the numerical modelling of complex flows in natural aquatic systems. I have placed particular emphasis on understanding transport and mixing as a consequence of the interaction between coherent turbulent structures and the transported solutes. I have also analysed transport dynamics across different scales using nonlinear evolution models and fractional derivatives to represent processes with multiple time scales.
