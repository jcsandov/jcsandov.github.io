Most physical problems in science and engineering depend on changes in multiple dimensions and these problems are described by Partial Differential Equations (PDE). These equations contain 2 or more partial derivatives, for example a time and a space dimension or multiple space dimensions.This course introduces first and second order PDEs and the solution properties for different classes of PDEs. Based on these different solution properties, we will develop analytical and numerical solution methods for the different classes of PDEs.

1.Introduction to and classification of partial differential equations (PDEs) <br>
2.Analytical solution of the Laplace, heat and wave equation: separation of variables, Laplace transform method, d'Alembert and characteristics <br>
3.Introduction to numerical methods for PDEs <br>
4.Application of the finite difference method to the different types of PDEs: boundary value problems for stationary PDEs, initial-boundary value problems for transient PDEs, handling of different boundary conditions, accuracy and stability of the solutions
