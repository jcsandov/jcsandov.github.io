In this course, students are provided with the tools necessary to: recognise and identify situations in which engineering design requires the use of Fluid Mechanics; develop simple quantitative models of fluid behaviour using different approaches—global, differential, and experimental; apply basic methods and techniques to analyse and quantify fluid behaviour; and understand the underlying assumptions, as well as the scope and limitations, of the different approaches.
