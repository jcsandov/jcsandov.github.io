The objective of this course is to develop and study the fundamental concepts and principles of fluid mechanics and their application both to fluids at rest and to the design and analysis of real fluid transport systems through pipes and open channels.

1. Introduction and Properties of Fluids: Definition
======
Fluid as a continuum and units; fluid properties: mass, specific weight and density, viscosity, surface tension, and capillarity.

2. Fluid Statics
=======
Law of hydrostatic pressure; determination of pressure forces on submerged plane surfaces; determination of pressure forces on submerged curved surfaces; absolute pressure, gauge pressure, and pressure-measuring instruments; buoyancy and flotation.

3. Fluid Kinematics
=======
Description of motion, velocity, and acceleration. Discharge and mean velocity.

4. Fluid Dynamics
=======
Conservation of mass; principle of energy conservation and the Bernoulli equation; dynamic applications of ideal fluids; principle of linear momentum.

5. ntroduction to Hydraulic Machines
=======
Pumps and turbines; efficiency. Cavitation.

6. Flow in Pipes
=======
Reynolds experiment; head losses due to friction in pipes; head losses due to local losses; analysis of pipe systems; pumping systems.

7. Flow in Open Channels
=======
Introduction to the study of open-channel flow. Concept of critical depth.
