This course introduces CFD by means of a set of lectures covering the background physics and mathematics, together with practical assignments that use commercial CFD software to solve flow problems. The need for error control and independent validation of results is stressed throughout. Although particular software (Star-CCM+) is used for the assignments, the underlying themes of the module are generic.

The student were taught to

1. Perform high quality flow simulations in two and three dimensions using a commercial CFD solver. <br>
2. Select appropriate physics models (e.g. laminar, turbulent, compressible, free surface, etc) needed for a particular flow simulation. <br>
3. Make use of meshing tools to produce high quality meshes with appropriate use of mesh refinement and coarsening. <br>
4. Use refinement analysis and other validation and verification techniques to demonstrate a solution is of the desired quality. <br>
5. Interpret computed solutions for both general and specialist audiences, using appropriate visualisation techniques, derived quantities, and solution monitors.
