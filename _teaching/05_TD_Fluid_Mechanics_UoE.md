A general form of the Navier-Stokes equation is derived with a focus on the physical interpretation of the mathematical model. This equation is used to derive simplified models for bidimensional incompressible flows, including potential flow and boundary layer flow. The fundamentals of turbulent flow, including basic turbulent statistics, are presented.
