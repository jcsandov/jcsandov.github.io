The objective of this course is to recognise the role of mathematical modelling in hydrology and its relationship to the design of engineering works; to carry out probabilistic studies of hydrological data series and infer their properties; to formulate and develop probabilistic models of hydrological phenomena and processes; to simulate hydrological variables; to infer the probabilities associated with different hydrological events; to interpret and handle pluviometric, pluviographic, and fluviometric records; to quantify the magnitude, duration, and intensity of rainfall associated with different probabilities; to model processes of the hydrological cycle; and to use and apply mathematical models to simulate hydrological cycle processes.
